:index:`MonitorSelfTime<single: MonitorSelfTime; ClassAd DaemonMaster attribute>`

``MonitorSelfTime``:
    The time, represented as the number of second elapsed since the Unix
    epoch (00:00:00 UTC, Jan 1, 1970), at which this daemon last checked
    and set the attributes with names that begin with the string
    ``MonitorSelf``.

:index:`MyAddress<single: MyAddress; ClassAd DaemonMaster attribute>`

``MyAddress``:
    String with the IP and port address of the *condor_master* daemon
    which is publishing this ClassAd.

    daemon last sent a ClassAd update to the *condor_collector*.

:index:`Name<single: Name; ClassAd DaemonMaster attribute>`

``Name``:
    The name of this resource; typically the same value as the
    ``Machine`` attribute, but could be customized by the site
    administrator. On SMP machines, the *condor_startd* will divide the
    CPUs up into separate slots, each with with a unique name. These
    names will be of the form "slot#@full.hostname", for example,
    "slot1@vulture.cs.wisc.edu", which signifies slot number 1 from
    vulture.cs.wisc.edu.

:index:`PublicNetworkIpAddr<single: PublicNetworkIpAddr; ClassAd DaemonMaster attribute>`

``RealUid``:
    The UID under which the *condor_master* is started.

:index:`UpdateSequenceNumber<single: UpdateSequenceNumber; ClassAd DaemonMaster attribute>`

``UpdateSequenceNumber``:
    An integer, starting at zero, and incremented with each ClassAd
    update sent to the *condor_collector*. The *condor_collector* uses
    this value to sequence the updates it receives.
