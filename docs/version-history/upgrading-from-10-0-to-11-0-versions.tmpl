Upgrading from a 10.0 LTS version of HTCondor to a 11.0 LTS version will also
introduce changes that administrators and users of sites running from an
older HTCondor version should be aware of when planning an upgrade. Here
is a list of items that administrators should be aware of.

- HTCondor will no longer pass all environment variables to the DAGMan proper manager
  jobs environment. This may result in DAGMan and its various parts (primarily PRE,
  POST,& HOLD Scripts) to start failing or change behavior due to missing needed
  environment variables. To revert back to the old behavior or add the missing
  environment variables to the DAGMan proper job set the :macro:`DAGMAN_MANAGER_JOB_APPEND_GETENV`
  configuration option.
