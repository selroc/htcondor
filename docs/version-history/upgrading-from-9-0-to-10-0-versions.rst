Upgrading from a 9.0 LTS version of HTCondor to a 10.0 LTS version will bring
new features introduced in the 9.x versions of HTCondor. These new
features include the following (note that this list contains only the
most significant changes; a full list of changes can be found in the
version history: \ `Version 9 Feature Releases <../version-history/development-release-series-91.html>`_):

- Users can prevent runaway jobs by specifying an allowed duration.

- Able to extend submit command and create job submit template.
  :jira:`802`
  :jira:`1231`

  :jira:`501`
- Improvements against replay attacks
  :jira:`287`
  :jira:`1054`

Upgrading from a 9.0 LTS version of HTCondor to a 10.0 LTS version will also
introduce changes that administrators and users of sites running from an
older HTCondor version should be aware of when planning an upgrade. Here
is a list of items that administrators should be aware of.

- The default for ``TRUST_DOMAIN``, which is used by with IDTOKEN authentication,
  has been changed to ``$(UID_DOMAIN)``.
  :jira:`1381`

  If you have already created IDTOKENs for use in your pool:

  #. Log in as root on a machine with an IDTOKEN.
  #. Run ``condor_token_list`` and retrieve the value of the ``iss`` field.
  #. Set the HTCondor configuration ``TRUST_DOMAIN`` to that value on each
     machine which should accept IDTOKENs;
  #. Restart HTCondor on those machines.

- Jobs that use a ``Requirements`` expression to try and match to specific a GPU should
  be changed to use the new ``require_gpus`` submit command or jobs will simply not match. If your machines
  have only a single type of GPU, you may be able to modify the machine configuration
  to allow users to delay having to make this change. This is a consequence of the fact
  that multiple GPUs of different types in a single machine is now supported.
  Attributes such as ``CUDACapability`` will no longer be advertised because it is not reasonable
  to assume that all GPUs will have a single value for this property.  Instead the properties of
  each GPU will be advertised individually in a format that allows a job to request it run
  on a specific GPU or type of GPU.
  :jira:`953`

- We have updated to using the PCRE2 regular expression library. This library
  is more strict with interpreting regular expression. If the regular
  expressions are properly constructed, the will be no difference in
  interpretation. However, some administrators have reported that expressions
  in their condor mapfile were rejected because they wanted to match the ``-``
  character in a character class and the ``-`` was not the last character
  specified in the character class. In addition, on Enterprise Linux 7,
  having a hyphen (``-``) in the last position after a POSIX character set
  (such as ``[:space:]``) in a character class was flagged as an invalid range,
  even though it should have been accepted.
  :jira:`1087`

- The semantics of undefined user job policy expressions has changed.  A
  policy whose expression evaluates to undefined is now uniformly ignored,
  instead of either putting the job on hold or treated as false.
  :jira:`442`
