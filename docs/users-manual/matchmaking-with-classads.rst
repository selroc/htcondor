Matchmaking with ClassAds
=========================

Before you learn about how to submit a job, it is important to
understand how HTCondor allocates resources.
:index:`resource allocation<single: resource allocation; HTCondor>` Understanding the unique
framework by which HTCondor matches submitted jobs with machines is the
key to getting the most from HTCondor's scheduling algorithm.

HTCondor simplifies job submission by acting as a matchmaker of
ClassAds. HTCondor's ClassAds :index:`ClassAd` are analogous to
the classified advertising section of the newspaper. Sellers advertise
specifics about what they have to sell, hoping to attract a buyer.
Buyers may advertise specifics about what they wish to purchase. Both
buyers and sellers list constraints that need to be satisfied. For
instance, a buyer has a maximum spending limit, and a seller requires a
minimum purchase price. Furthermore, both want to rank requests to their
own advantage. Certainly a seller would rank one offer of $50 dollars
higher than a different offer of $25. In HTCondor, users submitting jobs
can be thought of as buyers of compute resources and machine owners are
sellers.

All machines in a HTCondor pool advertise their attributes,
:index:`attributes<single: attributes; ClassAd>` such as available memory, CPU type
and speed, virtual memory size, current load average, along with other
static and dynamic properties. This machine ClassAd
:index:`machine<single: machine; ClassAd>` also advertises under what conditions it
is willing to run a HTCondor job and what type of job it would prefer.
These policy attributes can reflect the individual terms and preferences
by which all the different owners have graciously allowed their machine
to be part of the HTCondor pool. You may advertise that your machine is
only willing to run jobs at night and when there is no keyboard activity
on your machine. In addition, you may advertise a preference (rank) for
running jobs submitted by you or one of your co-workers.

Likewise, when submitting a job, you specify a ClassAd with your
requirements and preferences. The ClassAd
:index:`job<single: job; ClassAd>` includes the type of machine you wish to
use. For instance, perhaps you are looking for the fastest floating
point performance available. You want HTCondor to rank available
machines based upon floating point performance. Or, perhaps you care
only that the machine has a minimum of 128 MiB of RAM. Or, perhaps you
will take any machine you can get! These job attributes and requirements
are bundled up into a job ClassAd.

HTCondor plays the role of a matchmaker by continuously reading all the
job ClassAds and all the machine ClassAds, matching and ranking job ads
with machine ads. HTCondor makes certain that all requirements in both
ClassAds are satisfied.

Inspecting Machine ClassAds with condor_status
-----------------------------------------------

:index:`condor_status<single: condor_status; HTCondor commands>`

Once HTCondor is installed, you will get a feel for what a machine
ClassAd does by trying the *condor_status* command. Try the
*condor_status* command to get a summary of information from ClassAds
about the resources available in your pool. Type *condor_status* and
hit enter to see a summary similar to the following:

.. code-block:: text

    Name               OpSys      Arch   State     Activity LoadAv Mem   ActvtyTime

    amul.cs.wisc.edu   LINUX      INTEL  Claimed   Busy     0.990  1896  0+00:07:04
    slot1@amundsen.cs. LINUX      INTEL  Owner     Idle     0.000  1456  0+00:21:58
    slot2@amundsen.cs. LINUX      INTEL  Owner     Idle     0.110  1456  0+00:21:59
    angus.cs.wisc.edu  LINUX      INTEL  Claimed   Busy     0.940   873  0+00:02:54
    anhai.cs.wisc.edu  LINUX      INTEL  Claimed   Busy     1.400  1896  0+00:03:03
    apollo.cs.wisc.edu LINUX      INTEL  Unclaimed Idle     1.000  3032  0+00:00:04
    arragon.cs.wisc.ed LINUX      INTEL  Claimed   Busy     0.980   873  0+00:04:29
    bamba.cs.wisc.edu  LINUX      INTEL  Owner     Idle     0.040  3032 15+20:10:19
    ...


The *condor_status* command has options that summarize machine ads in a
variety of ways. For example,

 *condor_status -available*
    shows only machines which are willing to run jobs now.
 *condor_status -run*
    shows only machines which are currently running jobs.
 *condor_status -long*
    lists the machine ClassAds for all machines in the pool.

Refer to the :doc:`/man-pages/condor_status` command reference page for a
complete description of the *condor_status* command.

The following shows a portion of a machine ClassAd
:index:`machine example<single: machine example; ClassAd>` :index:`machine ClassAd`
for a single machine: turunmaa.cs.wisc.edu. Some of the listed
attributes are used by HTCondor for scheduling. Other attributes are for
information purposes. An important point is that any of the attributes
in a machine ClassAd can be utilized at job submission time as part of a
request or preference on what machine to use. Additional attributes can
be easily added. For example, your site administrator can add a physical
location attribute to your machine ClassAds.
