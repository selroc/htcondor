Mailing Lists
'''''''''''''

Our users support each other on a community unmoderated mailing list
(htcondor-users@cs.wisc.edu) targeted at solving problems with
HTCondor. HTCondor team members attempt to monitor traffic to
htcondor-users, responding as they can. Follow the instructions at
http://htcondor.org/mail-lists.
If you have a question or potential bug report for HTCondor that
can be asked on a public mailing list, this is the first place to go.

In addition, there is a very low-volume e-mail list at htcondor-world@cs.wisc.edu.
We use this e-mail list to announce new releases of
HTCondor and other major HTCondor-related news items. To subscribe or
unsubscribe from the list, follow the instructions at
http://htcondor.org/mail-lists.
The HTCondor World e-mail list group is moderated, and only
major announcements of wide interest are distributed.
